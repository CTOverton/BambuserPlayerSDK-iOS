## 1.0.0

This version features a complete native rewrite of the BambuserPlayerSDK.

* The BambuserPlayerSDK is now completely rewritten in pure Swift with SwiftUI as UI-framework.
* Player V2.0 design
    * Includes infinite highlighted products timeline
    * More modern design
* PiP context handling is now done internally, so you only need to handle restoring functionality.
* Possibility to hide even more of the UI through config

### üí• Breaking changes

* Most previous implementations will need to be redone
* Cart integration is removed (will be readded in a future version)
* Themeing is removed (will be readded in a future version)

### üêõ Known bugs
